# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project explores shell initialization files, variables, expansions, and various shell scripting concepts in Bash.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand shell initialization files (`/etc/profile`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.)
- Differentiate between local and global variables
- Master shell expansions and arithmetic operations
- Work with aliases and environment variables
- Perform base conversions and string manipulations

## Requirements

- All scripts tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts exactly 2 lines long
- First line: `#!/bin/bash`
- No use of `&&`, `||`, `;`, `bc`, `sed`, or `awk`
- All files must be executable

##Usage
Make scripts executable: chmod +x filename

For variable-setting scripts: use source filename or . filename

For scripts using environment variables: set them first with export VAR=value
